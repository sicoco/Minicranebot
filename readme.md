- basically a small mobile wheel-based platform with lightweight long robotic arm that can move around and pick things from far away without falling over.

- made most parts with 3d printer, including high gear ratio gearbox

- in order to reduce the time on prototyping and 3d printing, designed the robot's body in LEGO-ish style

- robot has 2WD and 4 caster wheel mobile platform, a 3dof planar robotic arm, 2 dof gripper, 1 dof adjustable counterweight

- able to pick about 100g at gripper and about 500g at elbow

- robot weight about 4kg because it is powered from switching power supply outside its body
